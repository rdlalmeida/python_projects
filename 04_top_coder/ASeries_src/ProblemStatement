Problem Statement
*** You may only submit a given problem once - no resubmissions will be accepted. ***

An arithmetic series consists of a sequence of terms such that each term minus its immediate predecessor gives the same result. For example, the sequence 3,7,11,15 is the terms of the arithmetic series 3+7+11+15; each term minus its predecessor equals 4. (Of course there is no requirement on the first term since it has no predecessor.)

Given a collection of integers, we want to find the longest arithmetic series that can be formed by choosing a sub-collection (possibly the entire collection). Create a class ASeries that contains a method longest that is given a values and returns the length of the longest arithmetic series that can be formed from values.
Definition
Class:
ASeries
Method:
longest
Parameters:
tuple (integer)
Returns:
integer
Method signature:
def longest(self, values):
Limits
Time limit (s):
840.000
Memory limit (MB):
64
Constraints
- values will contain between 2 and 50 elements inclusive.
- Each element of values will be between -1,000,000 and 1,000,000 inclusive.
Examples
0)
{3,8,4,5,6,2,2}
Returns: 5
No arithmetic series using these values is longer than 2,3,4,5,6.
1)
{-1,-5,1,3}
Returns: 3
-1, 1, 3 is an arithmetic series (so is 3,-1,-5).
2)
{-10,-20,-10,-10}
Returns: 3
-10,-10,-10 is an arithmetic series.
